      <h1> Working with 'exposed' racists to address racism: what could go wrong?</h1>
      <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px; margin:10;">
      This post is dedicated to Sammy and all the other black grad students that I do not know but I somehow still love.

Before I get started, 
- I do not like working within the system. Maybe at one point I believed in it but my experiences in life trying to effect positive momentum have made me skeptical. Working within the system at best leads to compromising where no compromise should be made and at worst (and unfortunately way more commonly) creates burnt out cogs in the system who ‚Äúhave given up on changing the world‚Äù
- My goal is positive momentum: positive- in a direction that benefits marginalized people, momentum - measurable, quantifiable and material change. 

Now I will begin the story and immediately contradict myself, as I was not only working within the system to make very little positive momentum but I also found myself sounding and looking very cog-like. Below is the usual timeline of incidents  
Egregious Racist Incident(ERI) -> ‚Äúreckoning‚Äù by people in power -> ineffectual committee 
Although in our case it looks more like 
blackface in a leadership party (ERI)-> blackface doer faces (some) consequences -> defensiveness by people in power -> petition in support of blackface doer 1, 2, 3 etc .. -> petitions hid and later exposed creating a second ERI -> ‚Äúreckoning‚Äù by people in power (who also may have signed one or more hidden petitions) -> ineffectual committee 

In my first year we had traversed the ERI and landed in the realm of petition signing and to me the only thing scarier than a petition supporting someone who did blackface was a secret petition supporting someone who did blackface. The efforts I put in to have an open conversation or even read these petitions were sidetracked by our program director whom everyone reminded me was one of the good white women. Over and over, my program mates attempted to pacify my deep fears that she did not support us by letting me know that her restraint must be a miscommunication (although we later found her name on a petition she claimed to have no idea how to track down). 
In hindsight, I do feel a bit naive. I had honestly believed that the people I surrounded myself with, both peers and professors, were unwitting at worst and supportive at best. But after a lot of work by a few concerned (quite a bit of it by me), a lot of lying and misdirection (a lot of it directly to me), my work being labeled "illguided and selfish‚Äù, my peers asking me ‚Äòrespectfully what's the point?‚Äù and my mental health reaching a new low, I was feeling sober. And  as we are finally able to find and read the petition, we find a lot of faculty in our program had signed in defense of the blackface doer and any notions of support are disabused.
 Now that the hidden petitions had been read and the mess was out in the open, DEI was on the forefront of all our program conversations and we were galvanized. Faculty feel emboldened to mention to me that our program director feels very regretful of her decision to sign and she is not nearly the most defiant one on the petition(which is apparently a good thing?). While students strategize that it is important to show a united front and imply to avoid doing anything that would rock the boat and make my peers leave the cause. We form a DEI committee and draft a mission and values statement (one I write almost entirely) and revise interview criteria (an honestly good thing that came out of this mess and one I absolutely credit to the few others on the committee who came to do work). Lastly we even get moderated conversations to discuss the incident, something we asked for a year past at that point. 
Knowing how hard I felt I worked for all of this, maybe you would be surprised to find myself not wanting to go. Or maybe you know how I feel, how I entered the program and this process so hopefully and now I have very little of that spirit left. It is funny that this is the best possible outcome within the system and it doesn‚Äôt feel very positive or that it has any momentum. And now that I have seen what the system really thinks of me, how then do I go to these workshops and try to love myself in a place that has made it clear that it dislikes exactly what I am?
I feel though that I will go, with some fidget toys for the nerves and a list of ideal demands I still have, not because I will be heard but to remind myself that I have a voice. And no matter where the conversation ends up, I am proud because I not only tried but I did it in a way that felt true to me as a system-hater trying their best within one. I found a lot of people who disagreed but the few that didn‚Äôt reminded me that the issue is not us but them. And it is those people that will outlast and outshine everyone in my life with their love and give me the strength to hope still.
